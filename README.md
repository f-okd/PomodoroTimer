# PomodoroTimer
The [Pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

Setup targets x64 runtimes, however its published as a self-contained application so you shouldn't run into any incompatibility issues; if you do however, feel free to fork and re-publish to support x86 and or ARM64 versions of the .NET Desktop runtimes.

## How to run
1. Download the latest release from the Releases page.
2. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location.
3. Double-click the executable file (Pomodoro Timer.exe) to launch the application.

Alternatively
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Start debugging (F5)
